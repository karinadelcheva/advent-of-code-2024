# Advent of Code 2024 🎄✨

Solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)!  
This repository contains my Python implementations for the daily challenges.
This year I'm trying to be more pythonic.

## 📚 About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming challenge is released, and participants solve them using their language of choice. 

## 🚀 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by day, with each day's solution in its own folder:

```markdown
├── 1/ 
│ ├── 1.1.py 
│ ├── 1.2.py 
│ └── input.txt 
├── 2/ 
│ ├── 2.1.py 
│ ├── 2.2.py 
│ └── input.txt 
...
```

- **`[day].[part].py`**: Python script containing the solution for the day's challenge. e.g. 1/1.1.py is day 1 part 1
- **`input.txt`**: The puzzle input used for the solution
